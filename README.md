# digital-logic-sim
Lubin Pappalardo's official Digital Logic Simulator.

This website was made from scratch using only HTML, CSS and Javascript with the Jquery library. No framework, no server, only static HTML. 
Everything was made by myself from moving the workspace around to the actual logic to simulate the digital logic.
